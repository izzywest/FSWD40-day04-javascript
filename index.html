    <br><h1>Basic 2 | Truncate</h1>
    <!-- Create a function that accepts two parameters. 1st parameter is a string and the 2nd is a number of characters that should be shortened by cutting off the string from left to right.

	For ex. If we pass the following arguments in the function 1st argument = "I am a hero from World of Warcraft" and 2nd argument = "12", we should get just the string "I am a hero"

    <br><h1>Basic 3 | Table Creation</h1>
    <!-- Create a JavaScript program that will boost the creation of a HTML table. Instead of writing many <td> or <tr> tags, create a function that accepts two arguments, one for number of columns and other for number of rows. Provide one button to the user labeled as "Create a table", after it clicks on it, prompt two windows, one for number of columns and another for number of rwos.
